# Merge Sort

## Due: Fri 11/18 at 11:59 PM

### No Googling the merge sort algorithm

- Create a program called `MergeSort.java`
- Create a void static method that implents the merge sort algorithm
  - For this, you will also need to create a void static method that merges two sorted subarrays into one sorted array
- In the main method:
  - Prompt the user to enter a filename containing the data to read in
  - Read from that file
  - The first line is the number of elements the file contains
  - Read the remaining lines into an array
  - Use the merge sort method you wrote to sort the array
  - Print the sorted array

***Example Input:***\
input1.txt\
***Example Output:***\
1, 2, 3, 7, 17, 19, 24, 30, 44, 85
