# Quick Sort

## Due: Wed 11/15 at 11:59 PM

### No Googling the quick sort algorithm

- Create a program called `QuickSort.java`
- Create a void static method that implements the quick sort algorithm
  - For this, you will also need to create a static method that partitions the array and returns the index of the pivot value after it has been partitioned
- In the main method:
  - Prompt the user to enter a filename containing the data to read in
  - Read from that file
  - The first line is the number of elements the file contains
  - Read the remaining lines into an array
  - Use the quick sort method you wrote to sort the array
  - Print the sorted array

***Example Input:***\

***Example Output:***\
